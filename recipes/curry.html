    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 medium onion chopped finely</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic minced</li>
        <li>4 heaping tablespoons Thai red curry paste</li>
        <li>4 cups chicken or vegetable broth</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>Juice of 1 lime</li>
        <li>3.5 ounces rice noodles</li>
        <li>1 (13.5 ounce) can full fat coconut milk</li>
        <li>2 cups cooked chicken</li>
        <li>Generous handful fresh basil torn</li>
        <li>Handful fresh cilantro chopped</li>
        <li>Chopped scallions to taste</li>
        <li>Salt & pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Lime wedges for serving (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the olive oil and onion to a large pot over medium-high heat. Saut√© for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Stir in the ginger, garlic, and curry paste, and cook for about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Add the broth, water, lime juice, and noodles. Increase heat to high and bring to a gentle boil.</li>
        <li>Stir in the coconut milk and chicken. Reduce heat to medium-low and let the soup simmer for 10 minutes. </li>
        <li>Stir in the basil, cilantro, and scallions. Season with salt & pepper as needed. </li>
        <li>Serve immediately with an extra wedge of lime on the side if desired. The noodles will soak up more liquid the longer you leave the soup. I suggest adding more chicken broth if you need to add more liquid (e.g. reheating leftovers the next day).</li>
    </ol>
